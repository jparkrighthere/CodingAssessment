1. First, I used Java for the coding exercise because I am currently learning the language in UW-Madison, and the language is the one that I feel the most confident. 
Java is widely used, has a large developer community, and is suitable for writing large scaled applications. 
I used several built-in libraries such as ArrayList, Comparator, and HashMap to handle data structures, BufferedReader and FileReader to read the CSV file, and SimpleDateFormat to parse the timestamp. 
I used HashMap because it is easier to pair payers and points and access the values(point) by key(payer). 
Also, I used BufferedReader rather than Scanner, because time complexity becomes the problem when CSV file becomes larger. 
It is a bit faster as compared to scanner since it simply reads sequence of characters.

2. One advantage of this solution is that it's easy to read and understand due to its modular structure and use of descriptive method names. 
Additionally, the solution uses a HashMap to keep track of the points earned by each payer, which allows for easy point deduction when spending points. 
However, one potential disadvantage is that the solution doesn't account for edge cases such as negative point values or invalid timestamp formats in the CSV file. 
Additionally, the solution doesn't provide any output if the total points spent exceeds the total points earned.

3. My favorite personal project is creating a website "Madbbong.com." My friends and I am still working on designing and coding a website using HTML and CSS.
The website is going to provide students ways to change their lifestyle in our city, Madison, including pages about academic information, housing, list of places to go around and eat, and even secondhand treasures.
Our team is planning to create a club in college next semester which will hold many activities and events related to our website and make a community with the members that brings positive effects on our college and city.
